# Meditation Tracker PWA
As part of my self-learning journey, I made a meditation tracking app using React, Tailwindcss, and Quotable API.

I created this project using some of the knowledge I gained in:
- HTML, CSS ,JavaScript
- Tailwindcss
- React
- React hooks (useState,useEffect,useNavigate)
- React Router
- API fetch requests
- Graphic Design
- Git & Github
